ESPIAL 2016

ESPIAL was a Technology exhibition held at St. Josephs Public School, Hyderabad, India in 2016. 
Students from class 5 to Class 10(ICSE) and class 11 & 12(ISC) participated in the exhibition, 
displaying various exhibits from eco technology, wireless technology, rocket propulsion tech, 
astrophysics to home science, geography and environmental sciences.

It was a pleasure for me to participate in the two day event. I lead a team of three as we presented on
the theme "TECHNOLOGY IN DEFENSE". As a senior secondary student, it was immensely pleasureable to be
part of the exhibition and get wonderful response for our work, from heads of departments, teachers and fellow students.

My team comprised four members- Karan, Prathik, Dharma and me.

We won the prize for the Best ESPIAL Project in the senior category.
