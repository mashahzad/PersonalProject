ESPIAL 2016

ESPIAL was a Technology exhibition held at St. Josephs Public School, Hyderabad, India in 2016. 
Students from class 5 to Class 10(ICSE) and class 11 & 12(ISC) participated in the exhibition, 
displaying various exhibits from eco technology, wireless technology, rocket propulsion tech, 
astrophysics to home science, geography and environmental sciences.

It was pleasure for me to participate in the two day event. I lead a team of three as we presented on
the theme "TECHNOLOGY IN DEFENSE". As a senior secondary student, it was an immense pleasure to be
part of the exhibition and we got wonderful responses for our work.

My team won the prize for the Best ESPIAL Project in the senior category.
