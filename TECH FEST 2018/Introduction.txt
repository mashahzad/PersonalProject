Tech Fest 2018

The Tech Fest 2018 was a one day technology exhibition held at my university college,
back in February of 2018. it was a worderful experience to participate and lead a team of 
six people, simultaneously working on two working models- namely "Electronic Voting Machine" 
and "Sample Presentation-internet of Things".

We won many praises from our professors and faculties from other depatments. We fell little
short of winning the prize for the best exhibit but were contented to be part of such a wonderful 
initiative. Each of us were looking forward for future such opportunities.

I hope we will get more such wonderful opportunities in the future.
